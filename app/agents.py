"""
The agent team. Each "agent" is one focused AI job with its own instructions:

  1. Triage        (AI)    - explain the buyer's complaint in plain words
  2. Collector     (code)  - gather every provable fact -> evidence E1, E2, ...
     Onboarding    (AI + code) - reads the case's call recordings; code checks every quote it picks
     Labeller      (AI)    - before that, works out who Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 are; the seller confirms it
  3. Investigator  (AI + read-only tools) - decides if extra checks are needed
  4. Rule checker  (code)  - looks up what banks expect for this reason (retrieval)
  5. Drafter       (AI)    - writes claims, each pointing at evidence ids
  6. Verifier      (code + AI judge) - strikes any claim that isn't proven
  7. Advisor       (code)  - fight / settle / review; the part to concede, in paise
  8. Settle writer (AI)    - polite note to the customer, wording only; the amount is added by code

The AI never gets a tool that changes anything. Only a human click does that.
